  "summary": "This code implements a data gathering and processing system for various agricultural and environmental grants. It fetches grant information from multiple sources (farming finder, woodland grants, vet visits, woodland offer), processes the data, generates embeddings and summaries using OpenAI services, and uploads the processed information to Azure AI Search. The system also manages manifests in S3 to track processed grants and handle updates.",
  "data_model": "The main data entities in this system are:\n\n1. Grant\n   - title: string\n   - content: string\n   - updateDate: Date\n   - url: string\n\n2. Manifest\n   - link: string\n   - lastModified: string\n   - documentKeys: string[]\n   - summariesKeys: string[]\n\n3.

Grants are fetched from various sources\n2. Grants are processed and chunked\n3. Embeddings and summaries are generated for each chunk\n4. Processed data is uploaded to Azure AI Search\n5. Manifests are updated and stored in S3\n\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n    Grant ||--|{ DocumentChunk : \"chunked into\"\n    Grant ||--|| Manifest : \"tracked by\"\n    DocumentChunk ||--|| AzureAISearch : \"uploaded to\"\n    Manifest }|--|| S3 : \"stored in\"\n```",

Chunking Algorithm:\n   - Split long documents into smaller chunks based on token limit\n   - Ensure chunks end at sentence boundaries when possible\n   - Add metadata (title, grant scheme name, source URL, chunk number) to each chunk\n\n3. Manifest Management:\n   - Track processed grants with their last modified dates\n   - Use manifests to determine which grants need processing\n   - Store manifests in S3 for persistence across runs",

  "non_functional": "1. Error Handling and Logging:\n   - Extensive use of try-catch blocks to handle errors\n   - Detailed error logging using a custom logger\n   - Graceful error recovery in some cases (e.g., fallback summary generation)\n\n2.
