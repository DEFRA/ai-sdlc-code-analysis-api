Reliability:\n   - Health checks configured for LocalStack service\n   - Restart policies set for Redis and MongoDB services\n\n4. Monitoring:\n   - LocalStack logs set to WARN level for reduced verbosity\n\n5. Scalability:\n   - Use of Docker Compose allows for easy service scaling\n   - Separate services for database (MongoDB) and cache (Redis)\n\n6. Maintainability:\n   - Use of Docker Compose for easy environment setup and teardown\n   - Consistent naming conventions and labeling in Dockerfile\n\n7. Compliance:\n   - Addition of curl in production image to meet CDP PLATFORM HEALTHCHECK REQUIREMENT\n\n8. Development Experience:\n   - LocalStack for simulating AWS services locally\n   - Hot-reloading capability in development Docker image (npm run docker:dev)\n\n9.
