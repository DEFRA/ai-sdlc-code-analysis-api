DocumentChunk\n\nAdditionally, there are two database collections:\n\n4. mongo-locks\n5. example-data\n\n## ERD Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n    Grant ||--|{ DocumentChunk : \"chunked into\"\n    Grant ||--|| Manifest : \"tracked by\"\n    DocumentChunk }|--|| AzureAISearch : \"stored in\"\n    Manifest }|--|| S3 : \"stored in\"\n    MONGO-LOCKS {\n        string id\n    }\n    EXAMPLE-DATA {\n        string id\n    }\n```\n\n## Detailed Breakdown of Models\n\n### 1. Grant\n- Fields:\n  - title: string\n  - content: string\n  - updateDate: Date\n  - url: string\n- Relationships:\n  - One Grant can be chunked into many DocumentChunks\n  - One Grant is tracked by one Manifest\n\n### 2. Manifest\n- Fields:\n  - link: string\n  - lastModified: string\n  - documentKeys: string[]\n  - summariesKeys: string[]\n- Relationships:\n  - One Manifest tracks one Grant\n  - Manifests are stored in S3\n\n### 3. DocumentChunk\n- Fields:\n  - chunk_id: string\n  - parent_id: string\n  - chunk: string\n  - title: string\n  - grant_scheme_name: string\n  - source_url: string\n  - content_vector: number[]\n- Relationships:\n  - Many DocumentChunks are created from one Grant\n  - DocumentChunks are stored in Azure AI Search\n\n### 4. mongo-locks (Collection)\n- Fields:\n  - id: string (indexed)\n\n### 5. example-data (Collection)\n- Fields:\n  - id: string (indexed)\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\n1. Grants are fetched from various sources\n2. Grants are processed and chunked into DocumentChunks\n3. Embeddings and summaries are generated for each DocumentChunk\n4. Processed DocumentChunks are uploaded to Azure AI Search\n5. Manifests are updated to track the processed Grants and stored in S3\n\nThe data flow involves several transformations:\n- Grants are broken down into smaller DocumentChunks\n- Embeddings (content_vector) are generated for each DocumentChunk\n- Summaries are created for each DocumentChunk (implied by summariesKeys in Manifest)\n\n## Data Validation and Integrity Checks\n\nThe code provided does not explicitly show data validation or integrity checks. However, some implicit checks can be inferred:\n\n1. The use of specific data types (e.g., string, Date) for fields suggests basic type checking.\n2. The presence of indexes on the 'id' field for both mongo-locks and example-data collections implies uniqueness constraints on these fields.\n3. The relationship between Grants and DocumentChunks (parent_id in DocumentChunk) suggests referential integrity.\n\nTo improve data integrity, it is recommended to implement explicit validation checks, such as:\n- Ensuring all required fields are present\n- Validating data formats (e.g., URL format for source_url)\n- Checking for duplicate entries\n- Implementing proper error handling for data processing and storage operations\n\nAdditionally, implementing a more robust database schema with defined constraints would further enhance data integrity.",
