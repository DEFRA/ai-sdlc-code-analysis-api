  "summary": "This code implements a data gathering and processing system for various agricultural and environmental grants. It fetches grant information from multiple sources (farming finder, woodland grants, vet visits, woodland offer), processes the data, generates embeddings and summaries using OpenAI services, and uploads the processed information to Azure AI Search. The system also manages manifests in S3 to track processed grants and handle updates.",
  "data_model": "The main data entities in this system are:\n\n1. Grant\n   - title: string\n   - content: string\n   - updateDate: Date\n   - url: string\n\n2. Manifest\n   - link: string\n   - lastModified: string\n   - documentKeys: string[]\n   - summariesKeys: string[]\n\n3. DocumentChunk\n   - chunk_id: string\n   - parent_id: string\n   - chunk: string\n   - title: string\n   - grant_scheme_name: string\n   - source_url: string\n   - content_vector: number[]\n\nData flow:\n1. Grants are fetched from various sources\n2. Grants are processed and chunked\n3. Embeddings and summaries are generated for each chunk\n4. Processed chunks are uploaded to Azure AI Search\n5. Manifests are updated and stored in S3\n\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n    Grant ||--o{ DocumentChunk : \"chunked into\"\n    Grant ||--o{ Manifest : \"tracked in\"\n    DocumentChunk ||--o{ AzureAISearch : \"uploaded to\"\n    Manifest ||--o{ S3 : \"stored in\"\n```",

Internal Service Interfaces:\n   - getFinderGrants(count: number): Fetches grants from \"Find funding for land or farms\" finder\n   - getWoodlandGrants(): Fetches woodland grants\n   - getVetVisits(): Fetches vet visit grants\n   - getWoodlandOfferGrants(): Fetches woodland offer grants\n   - process({ grants, scheme, searchClient, searchSummariesClient }): Processes grants and uploads to Azure AI Search\n   - generateEmbedding(chunk: string): Generates vector embeddings for content\n   - generateShortSummary(text: string, summaryTokenLimit: number): Generates a short summary for a given text\n   - uploadManifest(manifestData: Manifest[], manifestFilename: string): Uploads manifest to S3 bucket\n   - getManifest(manifestFilename: string): Retrieves manifest from S3 bucket",
  "business_logic": "1. Grant Processing Workflow:\n   - Fetch grants from various sources (farming finder, woodland grants, vet visits, woodland offer)\n   - Check if grants are new or updated compared to the existing manifest\n   - Chunk grant content into smaller parts\n   - Generate embeddings and summaries for each chunk using OpenAI services\n   - Upload processed chunks to Azure AI Search\n   - Update and store manifest in S3\n\n2. Chunking Algorithm:\n   - Split long documents into smaller chunks based on token limit\n   - Ensure chunks end at sentence boundaries when possible\n   - Include metadata (title, grant scheme name, source URL, chunk number) with each chunk\n\n3. Manifest Management:\n   - Track processed grants with their last modified dates\n   - Remove outdated grants from Azure AI Search\n   - Update manifest with newly processed grants\n\n4. Data Transformation:\n   - Convert HTML content to Markdown\n   - Strip links from Markdown content\n   - Generate short summaries of grant content",

Manifest file names for different grant schemes\n\nEnvironment variables are likely used for sensitive information like API keys and endpoints.",
  "infrastructure": "While no explicit infrastructure-as-code is present, the system requires:\n\n1. Azure AI Search:\n   - Two indexes: one for full content and one for summaries\n   - Vector search capabilities for embeddings\n\n2. AWS S3:\n   - Bucket for storing manifests\n\n3. Azure OpenAI:\n   - Deployment for text embedding model (text-embedding-ada-002)\n   - Deployment for text generation model (gpt-35-turbo-16k)\n\n4. Serverless compute environment:\n   - Likely Azure Functions or AWS Lambda to host the API endpoint and processing logic\n\n5. Networking:\n   - Outbound internet access for API calls to GOV.UK, OpenAI, and other services\n   - VPC configuration if using AWS, or VNET if using Azure\n   - Proxy configuration for making external requests",
  "non_functional": "1. Performance:\n   - Asynchronous processing for improved responsiveness\n   - Chunking of large documents to manage token limits and processing efficiency\n\n2. Security:\n   - Use of API keys for authentication with external services\n   - Proxy support for network security\n   - Potential use of Azure Key Vault or AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive configuration\n\n3. Reliability:\n   - Error handling and logging throughout the codebase\n   - Retry logic for OpenAI API calls\n\n4. Scalability:\n   - Use of cloud services (Azure AI Search, S3) that can scale\n   - Stateless processing allowing for horizontal scaling of compute resources\n\n5. Maintainability:\n   - Modular code structure with separation of concerns\n   - Use of configuration for environment-specific settings\n\n6. Compliance:\n   - Handling of potentially sensitive grant information\n   - Use of official GOV.UK API for data sourcing\n\n7. Monitoring and Logging:\n   - Extensive use of logging throughout the application\n   - Potential for integration with cloud monitoring services\n\n8. Data Integrity:\n   - Use of manifests to track processed grants and handle updates\n   - Checksums (MD5) used for identifying unique chunks and grants"
